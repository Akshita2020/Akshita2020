👋 Hi, I’m @Akshita2020

👀 I’m interested in the intersection of data analytics and business strategy. I'm particularly passionate about using data to drive informed decision-making.

🌱 I’m currently learning advanced techniques in machine learning and artificial intelligence, alongside my MBA in IT and HR.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that involve data visualization, statistical analysis, or any data-driven initiatives that align with business strategy.

😄 Pronouns: She/Her

⚡ Fun fact: I love solving complex puzzles, whether they're data-related or not!
